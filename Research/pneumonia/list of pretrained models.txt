Here are several pre-trained models that you can use for pneumonia detection from chest X-rays:

ResNet Family:

ResNet50, ResNet101
These models are known for their deep residual connections, which help in training very deep networks efficiently.

DenseNet Family:

DenseNet121, DenseNet169, DenseNet201
DenseNet models promote feature reuse through dense connections, which can be beneficial in capturing subtle differences in medical images.

VGG Family:

VGG16, VGG19
Despite being older architectures, VGG models are still popular due to their simplicity and strong performance when fine-tuned on specific tasks.

Inception Family:

InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2
These models incorporate multiple kernel sizes in parallel, allowing them to capture features at various scales.

EfficientNet Family:

EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB1, etc.
EfficientNet models achieve high accuracy with fewer parameters by balancing network depth, width, and resolution.

MobileNet Family:

MobileNetV2
Designed for resource-constrained environments, MobileNet models can be effective for applications requiring faster inference or deployment on edge devices.

Xception:

Xception uses depthwise separable convolutions, making it efficient while capturing complex features.
